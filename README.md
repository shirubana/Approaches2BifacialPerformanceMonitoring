### Setup Python Environment

Set up a Python virtual environment that includes all packages required to run the various parts of this project. A [Conda environment file](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) is provided [for convenient setup](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file). The file is located at [``./environment.yml``](environment.yml). Install the environment `gostein` by running from the repository root directory:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

and activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate gostein
```

You are now ready to build the documentation...
